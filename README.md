# My Sublime Text 3 Config

This is my Sublime Text 3 user configuration.

If you just want to take a look at my preference and not copy everything, have a look at my [Preferences.sublime-settings](Preferences.sublime-settings).

## Install

1. Open Sublime Text 3 and [install Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
2. Close ST3, and run the following commands on the command line. This will remove your existing user settings completly and replace with mine.

    ~~~sh
    $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text 3/Packages
    $ rm -rf User
    $ git clone https://github.com/GaryJones/sublime.git User
    ~~~

3. Open Sublime Text 3, and wait as Package Control installs the new [packages](Package Control.sublime-settings). Enjoy.
